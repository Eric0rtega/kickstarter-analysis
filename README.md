# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

In this project I helped Louise, an upcoming play writer review and sort a large dataset and create graph, table and chart visualizations so that she may create a successful marketing campaign in earning enough money from backers to successfully launch some of her own plays. She has estimated a budget of over $10,000 to fund her play Fever. In this project we created pivot tables and charts by filtering through the data to help Louise understand greater details about launching a successful campaign. We learned that a campaigns success or failure was dependent on many different factors such as the type of play, category, launch date, and the pledge goal.

Below are some images of our findings:

From our analysis we discovered that plays in the theatre category launched in May had the highest success rate. Also those with a moderate budget, around $5,000 had a much higher success rate than those of over $10,000 budget.
