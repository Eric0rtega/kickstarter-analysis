# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project

### For this analysis we went through the same kickstarter data set to find the outcomes of the Theater category in comparison with the Launch Date. We also did a second analysis to find the number of Successful play campaigns, Failed play campaigns, and Canceled play campaigns. We then took that data and found the some of all the outcomes combined to then find the percentage of the outcomes for each. Our main goal of the second analysis was to find the different outcomes by pledge goal amount.

### Through this analysis I encountered a few problems with my data. The first issue that arose was that I was learning formulas and advanced concepts in Excel. I Overcame that with extra research and my Google Fu skills. There were a few points in my analysis where I struggled with the data conversions and creating tables of only the select data that I needed in my analysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	* My first conclusion I would make according to the outcomes based on launch date is that the months, May and June are the most popular months to launch a campaign.

	* My second conclusion is that the proportions for Failed and Successful campaigns are very close year round possibly resulting in a more competitive market through the months of May and June.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	* My conclusion for the outcomes based on goals is that the lower the pledge goal amount the higher the campaign success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	* I don't think I would say there are limitations with this dataset, what you are looking for I think you can find. Unless we include more data such as Parental Ratings and Age groups but that included data would be useless in our analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	* I think a pie chart would look lovely to display the Outcomes by Goals, besides that, all other analysis would look best in tables or graphs as we displayed them.
